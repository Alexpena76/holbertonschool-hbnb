"""
Facade Pattern Implementation
Provides a unified interface to coordinate operations across
business logic and persistence layers

class HBnBFacade:
    """
    Facade class that coordinates all business operations
    
    This class serves as the single point of entry for all
    business logic operations. It manages repository instances
    and will coordinate complex operations involving multiple
    entities and business rules.
    
    Design Benefits:
        - Simplifies API layer implementation
        - Encapsulates subsystem complexity
        - Provides consistent interface
        - Centralizes business logic coordination

        Initialize facade with repository instances
        
        Creates separate repository instances for each entity type.
        This allows independent management of different data types
        while maintaining a unified interface through the facade.
